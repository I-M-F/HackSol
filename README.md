# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
# HackSol

Smart Contract Security - Hardhat Project

The objective of this Project is to understand how to develop a smart contract in the safest way possible.

To achieve this purpose, since the contracts in a large percentage represent real money, we present most known vulnerabilities and know how old hacks worked so as not to repeat those same errors.

This Project not only focuses on the most known vulnerabilities currently but is also good practices, explanation of patterns and problems of these, for example, conflicts when using upgradeable contracts or how to obtain random numbers within a deterministic blockchain.
